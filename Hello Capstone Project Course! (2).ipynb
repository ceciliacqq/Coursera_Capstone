Traffic collisions often result in injury, disability, death, and property damage as well as financial costs to both society and the individuals involved. So, the accident severity is much more important prediction in the car accident.\n\n1.2 Problem\nData that might contribute to determine accident severity includes weather, location, road condition, light condition, speeding, accident code and time etc. This project aims to build a model which can predict accident severity with conditions inputs in the future.\n\n1.3 Interest\nObviously, Seattle traffic would be very interested in accurate prediction of accident severity. Others who may be interested in car accident such as pedestrians and insurance company."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
